# nlauncher

My personal launcher.

## Todo's
- [] flake refactor like nosd
- [] shell cmd
- [] converter (money, time)
- [] calc
- [] search file

## Possibilities
- [] MB Hyprland Config, install script
- [] HM config

## Rust Gui Lib
- [x] gtk4rs : Quite mature, wayland ok, layershell.
- X Qt Rust binding: abandon / not practical but layershell.
- ? GPUI (zed ui): Too immature, too powerful just for a launcher.
- X Egui: Too immature, problem with wayland (A lead on Layer Shell:)
- X Dioxus: Too immature, with a lot of garbage.
- X Rust + flutter : not practical.
