# nlauncher

My personal launcher.

## Todo's
- [] flake refactor like nosd
- [] Capslock
- [] Source
- [] Keep event with bind ? MB directly define in flake.

## Futur
- [] Config like hyprland

## Rust Gui Lib
- [x] gtk4rs : Quite mature, wayland ok, layershell.
- X Qt Rust binding: abandon / not practical but layershell.
- ? GPUI (zed ui): Too immature, too powerful just for a launcher.
- X Egui: Too immature, problem with wayland (A lead on Layer Shell:)
- X Dioxus: Too immature, with a lot of garbage.
- X Rust + flutter : not practical.
